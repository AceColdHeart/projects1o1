    <h2>Looking For Bierocks???</h2>
    <img src="img/berrock.png" alt="Picture of berrock shop sandwich" />
    <p>You've come to the right place! Since 1977, The Berrock Shop has been making delicious, made from scratch bierocks by hand each day...just like you would at home if you had the time.</p>
    <h2>But, what's up with the spelling???</h2>
    <p>It's true, The Berrock Shop is spelled differently. Back in 1989, when we purchased the restaurant from two elderly ladies with an awesome recipe for bierocks, we asked them the same question. In fact, at the time there were a couple of other bierock places in town, with the third spelling, "beerock." You see, back then, "beerock" though incorrect, was actually the most widely accepted spelling for this beloved Russian-German favorite.</p>
    <p>The ladies who originally started The Berrock Shop decided to spell their restaurant, "berrock" because they felt it was more phonetically correct...closer to the actual pronunciation. In addition, they wanted to distinguish themselves from their competition.</p>
    <h2>Through the years...</h2>
    <p>Through the years, the public has become more educated about bierocks, and now the correct spelling is more prevalent than ever. But when we took over The Berrock Shop, we didn't dare change what the two ladies had begun back in 1977...and as we discovered after almost thirty years, as long as you make great bierocks, people don't care how you spell them...and the rest, as they say...is history. </p>

      <h2>Looking For Bierocks???</h2>
      <img src="img/sandwich.png" alt="">
      <p>The Berrock Shop began in 1977 when two ladies with a great berrock recipe opened a restaurant at the corner of Clinton & Weber in Fresno, California. It was a small sandwich shop...just a hole in the wall, really. They served their specialty, ground beef and cabbage berrocks, plus a variety of sandwiches, a few homemade deli salads, and a daily soup. They did a respectable business from their little shop, but as the years went on and they got older, the work became more than they wanted to commit to and in 1989, they decided to retire and sell their business to a young couple who were first time entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>The ladies taught us how to make their famous berrocks...working along side us for a week or so to make sure we were ready to carry on the tradition, and finally, the torch was passed in October of 1989.</p>
      <p>We brought to this business a strong work ethic and a vision...We would create a place where the food was the focus. Everything had to be absolutely made from scratch like you would at home...in small batches each day. Real food made by real people, not machines...where the mixing and prepping are done by hand and where you would use only quality ingredients. The world was moving faster, but we wanted a simple place, quiet atmosphere with the best comfort food...nothing fancy or trendy...just good, wholesome food reminiscent of years gone by.</p>
      <p>The berrocks were our specialty, of course, and over time, we began to introduce other varieties. We were the first in our area to do this. Our first new variety was the shredded beef berrock, made with lean roast that is actually shred by hand. The barbeque beef and Mexican berrocks followed, along with the breakfast berrocks and the hors d'oeuvre berrocks which are so popular for entertaining. Since our berrocks are all hand made, not machine made, we are able to customize them in size and variety.</p>
  <img src="img/salads.png" alt="">
      <p>Our first year was full of menu improvements. We began making our own bread for the burgers and sandwiches, made homemade soups rather than serving canned, and expanded the deli salads with the addition of pasta, bean and rice pudding. Soon our famous chicken pot pies were introduced, and they quickly became a permanent menu item. We baked our own cookies which are actually old family recipes and offered fruit pies and turnovers with our delicious flaky crust.</p>
      <p>Before long, our slogan, "Where Homemade is the Difference," was born, because it was clear that our passion for home cooking was what set us apart from our competitors. It wasn't about factory produced, high volume wholesaling...it was about the food. And by 1997, we had outgrown our small shop at Clinton and Weber and moved to our current larger location at Bullard and West Avenues in North Fresno.</p>
      <p>We continued to expand our menu, adding more fresh salads and sandwich choices. But we never forgot what got us here...that little shop at Clinton & Weber where we proudly made all our food from scratch in small batches...the way we still do...almost 30 years later.</p>
