  <h1>Link Crew</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
     We help freshman settle into high school and talk to them about our expirences. We also take them on a tour around the school, but in case they forget on the first day of school we wear our Link Crew T-shirts so they may come and ask us for help. By doing this I have helped the next generation of the graduating class and also could have given them something to live up to.</li>
